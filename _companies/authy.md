description: Authy is a cloud authentication service exposed via an API. It is commonly
  used for the addition of two-factor authentication (2FA) to existing username and
  password logins. However it can also be used to replace the password for primary
  logins, as well as providing a robust and secure mechanism for the approval of high
  value transactions.
