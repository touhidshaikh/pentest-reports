description: "Veriflow began with a simple but challenging question: why can\xE2\u20AC\
  \u2122t today\xE2\u20AC\u2122s networks function with the same availability, security\
  \ and can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t-fail precision as engineering efforts like Mars rovers?\
  \ Our breakthrough came with the development of continuous network verification,\
  \ which builds a deep understanding of network infrastructure to model and mathematically\
  \ verify network-wide policies, providing intuitive, actionable insight. Veriflow\
  \ is the first networking company to leverage this technology to eliminate network\
  \ outages and vulnerabilities which can lead to astronomical losses."
