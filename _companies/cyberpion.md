description: Cyberpion solves the rising cybersecurity challenge of understanding
  the risks and vulnerabilities of your connected online assets that form an external
  attack surface. Knowing how your organization is vulnerable, where those threats
  come from, and what infrastructures are at risk, is critical to preventing an attack
  before it happens. Cyberpion helps organizations mitigate these advanced threats
  by continuously monitoring, discovering, and assessing the threat vectors present
  throughout online ecosystems that exist outside the traditional security perimeter.
  With an R&D team based in Israel, the company is funded by leading cybersecurity
  venture capitalists. To learn more, visit cyberpion.com.
