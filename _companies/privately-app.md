description: "The Privately App and their solution, Oyoto, are using artificial intelligence\
  \ to increase cybersecurity by helping to create smart, responsible digital citizens.\
  \ Privately helps kids learn how to be safe online, and teaches them when they make\
  \ mistakes. For example, if your child posts their new email address to Facebook,\
  \ Privately will let them know via their smartphone that it\u2019s better to send\
  \ that info in private messages. Then, the child can decide which steps to take\
  \ next."
