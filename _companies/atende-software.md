description: "With redGuardian by Atende Software you can mitigate terabit scale DDoS\
  \ attacks and protect your customers. redGuardian dataplane easily scrubs 100Gbps\
  \ and 100Mpps of DDoS traffic on a single COTS 1RU x86 box. Internally it uses DPI,\
  \ state filters and regular expressions to enforce good traffic, and does not rely\
  \ on external DDoS analytics. This leads to great accuracy, faster deployment and\
  \ lower costs when compared to custom ASIC/FPGA-based solutions.\r\nDeployment models\
  \ available: on premise (software license for 10-100 Gbit ports), global network\
  \ of BGP-based scrubbing centers."
