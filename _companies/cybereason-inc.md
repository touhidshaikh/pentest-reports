description: Cybereason is an endpoint detection and response platform, deploying
  a user-level easy to deploy, frictionless endpoint silent sensor and deploying an
  analytical engine to detect even faint evidence of malicious activity. Cybereason
  reconstructs evidence into a clear image of a cyberattack in context. This enables
  enterprises to discover sophisticated targeted threats at a very early stage, and
  effectively respond to them, reducing the costs and damages caused by such attacks.
