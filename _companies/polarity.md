  \ makes this possible through software. The system analyzes the contents of users\u2019\
  \ computers screens and gives them real-time access to information without affecting\
  \ their existing workflow. The system makes it easy to capture new \u201Cmemories\u201D\
  \ so that if other users are looking at similar content, they will automatically\
  \ be notified of the most relevant information at the most opportune time."
