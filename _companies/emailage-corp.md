description: "Emailage Risk Assessment acts as an up-front layer of security to help\
  \ global enterprises reduce fraud risk while approving more transactions. In the\
  \ form of an easy-to-understand risk score, fraud teams receive an accurate prediction\
  \ of a transaction\u2019s risk. This allows for automatic approval of transactions\
  \ deemed low-risk, while providing the ability to block or send for manual review\
  \ only the highest-risk transactions. Emailage Risk Assessment increases profits\
  \ by reducing fraud, lowering manual review costs and boosting acceptance rates."
