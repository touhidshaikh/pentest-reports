description: 'Drawbridge Networks was founded upon a key realization: attackers WILL
  get inside the network. Working from this understanding, cyber security veterans
  John Terrill and Tom Cross decided to focus their efforts beyond the first point
  of compromise, to catch successful attackers as they attempt to infect other internal
  devices. They invented a unique approach to network micro-segmentation, enabling
  enterprises to learn, detect, and automatically respond to internal attacks.'
