description: "Cybersecurity is hard. Attacks are non-stop and threat vectors change\
  \ constantly. As a result, some companies may not know where to begin while others\
  \ employ a robust set of tools, policies, and routine assessments to try to stay\
  \ on top of it all.   \r\n\r\nPlexTrac is a revolutionary, yet simple, Cybersecurity\
  \ platform that centralizes all security assessments, penetration test reports,\
  \ bug bounty submissions, audit findings and vulnerabilities into a single location.\
  \ PlexTrac improves the entire security engagement lifecycle by making it easy to\
  \ generate security reports, deliver them securely, and track the issues to completion\
  \ straight from the platform. No more dealing with large Word or PDF documents.\
  \ No more tracking metrics across multiple spreadsheets.  \r\n\r\nPlexTrac is perfect\
  \ for consultants and businesses alike. For consultants, PlexTrac was written to\
  \ simplify and speed up your report writing process. You can show off your hard\
  \ work in a clean and professional way and collaborate with clients directly through\

  \  \r\n\r\nFor businesses, you can centralize all of your security assessments and\
  \ audit reports in a single platform for easy assignment and tracking. No more copy\
  \ and paste from multiple tools, documents, and spreadsheets. Gain a historical\
  \ view of your progress over time and focus on your overall security program from\
  \ a single pane of glass.  \r\n\r\nPlexTrac is the new standard in security reporting\
