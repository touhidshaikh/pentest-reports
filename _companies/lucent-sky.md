description: Lucent Sky has developed a new application security testing technology
  that enables application layer vulnerabilities to be removed from the source code
  in a centralized and automated manner. Existing applications can rapidly increase
  their security posture in one scan by removing vulnerabilities en masse, enabling
  old applications to be compliant with new security standards.
